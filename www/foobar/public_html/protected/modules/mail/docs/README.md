# Mail

Communicate privately with one or more users. Clarify details which you do not want to discuss publicly and thus free your network from questions of detail that are not relevant to the general public.

## Overview

- Exchange your thoughts in private
- Discuss views with multiple discussion partners in groups
- Liven up the discussion with pictures and attachments
- Clarify your point with a wide range of formatting options

## Build

In order to build script or stylesheet run:

Install npm packages:

```
npm install
```

Manually build:

```
grunt build
```

Watch for file changes:

```
grunt watch
```

> Note: While development you should set the `forceCopy` publish option of the mail asset bundles to true.
